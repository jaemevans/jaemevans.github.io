          <p className="jaelyn">hello i am jaelyn.</p> i am a junior studyng computer science at
          the university of illinois at urbana champaign. i am passionate about
          using technology to create inovative products for humans that can improve society. my interests
          lie within front-end development, ui/ux design and health technology.
          i am currently co-op'ing with motorla solutions as a full stack intern
          where i have been able to improve my programming, communication, and
          ping pong skills all while being a full time student. last summer i
          also interned with motorola solutions where i had the opportunity to
          collaborate on teams of four and five to conceptualize, design, and
          develop a comprehensive mobile application that served as a go-to
          resource hub for people experiencing homelessness and an innovative
          crowd sourced learning platform that enabled MSI employees to review,
          rate and share online courses.

          additionally, i am very passionate about dei. as a black woman
          pursuing a degree in stem, i am passionate about promoting diversity,
          equity, and inclusion in the field. through my experiences in the
          industry and in academia, i have come to realize the importance of
          outreach work in educating future generations of underrepresented
          students. i aspire to empower young geniuses to find passion in stem and
          pursue higher level education. i am a member of uiuc's national
          society of black engineers (NSBE) chapter where i actively participate
          on their high school visitation comitee to plan events for prospective
          students interested in engineering at UIUC. i aslo volunteer with a
          program here at illinois called WYSE, which strives to overcome
          opportunity gaps by providing students from historically excluded
          populations with opportunities to experience success and to see
          themselves as future engineers. through WYSE i have been able to
          champion the next generation of underrepresented STEM leaders in K-12
          by providing immersive, hands-on mentorship and cultivating a passion
          for innovation and discovery. upon graduation, i plan to continue my
          outreach work by creating my own STEM outreach/afterschool program for innercity
          kids from chicago, a place i hold close to my heart.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          outside of all that, i thourghly enjoy cycling, geography, thrifting,
          listening to music, and hanging out with friends. check out below to
          see what im currently up to.
