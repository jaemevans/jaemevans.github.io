My personal website developed from scratch using React and designed in Figma. Deployed using Github pages.

i wanna give a shoutout to the numerous stack overflow posts and youtube videos that helped me develop this site. really could not have
done it without you.

also thank you flaticon library for the icons, you are a real one.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
